# Bulkan 🐾  
**Wildlife Awareness Landing Page**


Bulkan is a single-page educational website focused on raising awareness about endangered animal species and wildlife protection.


This project is intentionally built as a **junior-level React application** with a strong focus on **HTML, CSS, and UI structure**, while using only core React fundamentals.


---


##  Project Goals


- Showcase strong HTML & CSS skills
- Practice core React concepts (components, props, basic state)
- Build a clean and readable component structure
- Avoid over-engineering and advanced React patterns
- Create a long, structured landing page similar to real-world websites


---


##  Technical Overview


### Technologies Used
- React (with Vite)
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Pure CSS (no frameworks, no libraries)




These limitations are intentional to reflect a **learning-stage React developer** while keeping the code easy to read and understand.

##  Styling & UI


- Pure CSS (one CSS file per component)
- Strong focus on:
  - Layout
  - Spacing
  - Typography
  - Visual hierarchy
- CSS animations and transitions:
  - Section entrance effects
  - Button hover states
  - Card interactions
- Nature-inspired color palette (green tones, soft backgrounds)


No CSS frameworks or third-party styling tools were used.
