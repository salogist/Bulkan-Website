          Bulkan is a student-led initiative dedicated to shining a light on the
          plight of endangered species across the globe. This project serves as
          a demonstration of foundational web development skills, combining pure
          CSS for styling and beginner-level React for structure. Our goal is to
          create an engaging and informative experience that raises awareness
          and inspires action for wildlife conservation.
